# Random Models for Signed Directed Social Networks

## Signed Directed Social Network
In a signed directed network $G = (V, E, s)$, where $V$ the
vertex set, $E$ the directed-edge set, a function $s : E → {+, −}$ assigns
a sign for each directed edge in the network. Therefore, each edge $e ∈ E$ has
two attributes: sign and direction. A positive edge $e ∈ E+$ directed from a
member $A$ to another member $B$ indicates the friendly attitude from $A$ to
$B$. Similarly, a negative edge $e ∈ E−$ directed from a member $A$ to another
member $B$ indicates a hostile attitude from $A$ to $B$.


In this research, we proposed random models to generate a signed directed network that can mimic empirical networks. These models and required theoretical background can be found in my [MSc thesis dissertation, Chapter 3](https://open.library.ubc.ca/media/download/pdf/24/1.0347257/4)
