# Random Models for Signed Directed Social Networks

## Signed Directed Social Network
In a social group, the mutual attitude among the members (e.g. persons)
can be represented by a signed directed network $G = (V, E, s)$, where V the
vertex set, E the directed-edge set and the function s : E → {+, −} assigns
a sign for each directed-edge in the network [Hei46, Dav77].
In G, each vertex v ∈ V represents an individual member, and each
signed-directed-edge e ∈ E represents the attitude from a source vertex
(member) to a target vertex. Based on the sign, E can be partitioned as
E = E+ ∪ E−, where E+ ∩ E− = ∅, and E+ and E− are the set of all
positive and negative edges respectively. Therefore, each edge e ∈ E has
two attributes: sign and direction. A positive edge e ∈ E+ directed from a
member A to another member B indicates the friendly attitude from A to
B. Similarly, a negative edge e ∈ E− directed from a me
